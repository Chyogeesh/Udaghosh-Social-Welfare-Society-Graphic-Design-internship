Task 1: Book Cover – Rich vs Poor
Design Concept
To highlight the contrast between rich and poor lifestyles without clichés, the cover uses a split-screen metaphor with a modern, symbolic approach:

Left Side (Rich): Represents wealth through sleek, minimalist visuals (e.g., a gold-accented city skyline at dusk, symbolizing luxury and opportunity).
Right Side (Poor): Depicts struggle through a textured, grayscale urban scene (e.g., a weathered wall or modest housing), symbolizing resilience.
Central Divide: A jagged, diagonal split (like cracked glass) symbolizes the societal fracture between the two worlds, with the title bridging the divide to suggest dialogue.
Typography: Bold, sans-serif fonts for a modern look, with the title in contrasting colors (gold for “Rich,” gray for “Poor”) to reinforce the theme.
Author Name: Positioned subtly at the bottom for balance.
Specifications
Size: 6 x 9 inches (1800 x 2700 pixels at 300 DPI)
Color Mode: CMYK for print
Bleed: 0.125 inches (37.5 pixels) on all sides
Safe Margin: 0.25 inches (75 pixels) from edges for text and critical elements
Format: PSD (layered for editability) + JPG (high-quality export)
Design Details
Background:
Left half: A sleek cityscape with gold and deep blue hues (CMYK: 10, 20, 80, 0 for gold; 80, 50, 0, 20 for blue).
Right half: A grayscale urban texture (e.g., cracked concrete, CMYK: 0, 0, 0, 50) with muted tones.
Diagonal split effect: A jagged white-to-transparent gradient (created with a layer mask) to blend the halves dynamically.
Title: “Rich vs Poor”
Font: Montserrat Bold (modern, clean sans-serif)
Size: ~120 pt for “Rich” and “Poor,” ~80 pt for “vs”
Color: “Rich” in gold (CMYK: 10, 20, 80, 0), “Poor” in gray (CMYK: 0, 0, 0, 70), “vs” in white (CMYK: 0, 0, 0, 0)
Position: Centered, spanning the split, within safe margins
Author Name: “Mr. A”
Font: Open Sans Regular
Size: 36 pt
Color: White (CMYK: 0, 0, 0, 0)
Position: Bottom center, 0.5 inches from bottom edge
Effects: Subtle drop shadow on text for depth (Opacity: 30%, Distance: 5px, CMYK: 0, 0, 0, 80).
Print-Readiness: Bleed area includes extended background imagery to ensure no white edges during printing.
